Water the beds with 'Captan' solution [3g/liter] and cover with\r\nnews paper sheets. Seeds start germination in 4-6 days. At this stage the news paper sheets have to be removed  preferably during evening hours. Seeds can be sown plug trays with coir peat too to get seedlings with root ball. After germination the plants would be ready for transplanting to flower beds or big pots in three weeks time.\r\n\r\nGrowing Instruction:\r\nAfter trans planting the seedlings to beds or pots, fertilizer application in solution form [1g of 17:17:17 N:P:K/liter] has to be followed for better growth plants. The first dose can be started from 10th day after transplanting. Drenching with 'Bavistin' or 'Ridomil' at 1.50 g/liter, once in 15 days is advised during rainy season to protect the plants from fungal diseases. To keep the sucking insects at bay alternate spraying of 'Dimethoate' and 'Monocrotohos' at 1ml/liter at 15 days interval would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nSowing Season:\r\nIn mild climates Marigolds can be grown round the year with slightly better care during summer months.
